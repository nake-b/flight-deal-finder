# flight-deal-finder
Simple Python program for finding cheap flight deals, using a Google Sheet and multiple APIs. The program works by inputing names of cities you would like to visit in a Google Sheet, 
as well with the maximum price you are willing to pay for the flight ticket. The program then updates the Sheet with IATA codes, and tries to find available flights. If it finds
any flights, it sends an e-mail. In order for the program to work, the corresponding API endpoints and keys need to be stored in an .env file. Contact me personally
if you want to use mine.
